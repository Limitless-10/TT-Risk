Slight notes/summary of thread:
- "Bold" and "Safe" decisions within risk managed can be graphed and compared
- Displacing the mean of these effects does not have impact on the decision-making process, rather the difference in means and the standard deviation does
- This effect does not translate within behavioural economics
- If one assumes external shock is uncorrelated with risks (which is a non-trivial assumption), then variance is additivie in the sense that if it the risks behaved in an uncorrelated fashion, then it is the square the combined risk which is the sum of the squares of the individual risks
